# mario-party-timer

This is an app I threw together in a few hours for a Mario Party themed Halloween party. It is a game clock for our Mario Party inspired games. This app also was an opportunity for me to learn and use Vuejs.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
